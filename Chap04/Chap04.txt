함수

def를 이용한다.

정수형과 실수형을 표현식에 동시에 사용할 때
정수는 암시적으로 실수형으로 변환된다.

값을 반환하지 않는 함수 = "void" 함수
값을 반환하는 함수 "fruitful" 함수	fruitful: 생산적인

Exercise 4.1: Run the program on your system and see what numbers
you get. Run the program more than once and see what numbers you
get.

Exercise 4.2: Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function
call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error
message you get.

answer) NameError: name 'repeat_lyrics' is not defined

Exercise 4.3: Move the function call back to the bottom and move the
definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics. What
happens when you run this program?

answer) This doesn't cause an error because both functions are defined
		before repeat_lyrics is called.

Exercise 4.4: What is the purpose of the “def” keyword in Python?

Exercise 4.6: Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for over-
time and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters
(hours and rate).

Exercise 4.7: Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using
a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and
returns a grade as a string.
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
Enter score: 0.95
A
Enter score: perfect
Bad score
Enter score: 10.0
Bad score
Enter score: 0.75
C
Enter score: 0.5
F
Run the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input.
