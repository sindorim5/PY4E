Exercise 5.1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the
user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count,
and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error
message and skip to the next number.

Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done
16 3 5.333333333333333

Exercise 5.2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers
as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of
the numbers instead of the average.
